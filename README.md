Credit card fraud detection using Machine Learning Algorithm in Python

## Objectives

The credit card fraud detection problem includes modelling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud.
This model is then used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. 
Our aim here is to detect maximum of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.

## Description of Dataset

This dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in the year 2023. 
It comprisesÂ over 550,000 records
It is taken from Kaggle website.
The data has been anonymized to protect the cardholders' identities.

#### Insights

Easier to predict as the data is well balanced, clean and clear cut  
Model could also be biased so will need more data as input to better train the model  
Having a split of more training data does not always result in better accuracies due to overfitting. Similarly, too little of training data may result in underfitting. 
Number of iterations also play apart in the accuracy of model.
