# SCTP-CapstoneProject
Credit card fraud detection using Machine Learning Algorithm in Python for my Associate Data Analyst course.

## Objectives

- The credit card fraud detection problem includes modelling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud.
- This model is then used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. 
- Our aim here is to detect maximum of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.

## Description of Dataset

- This dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in the year 2023. 
- It comprisesÂ over 550,000 records.
- It is taken from Kaggle website.
- The data has been anonymized to protect the cardholders' identities. 

## Steps Involved

- Importing the required packages into our python environment
- Importing the dataset
- Processing the data to our needs and exploratory data analysis
- Feature selection and data split
- Building classification models

## Confusion Matrix (Logistic Regression)

## Insights

- Easier to predict as the data is well balanced, clean and clear cut.
- Model could also be biased. So, we will need more data to better train the model,  
- Having a split of more training data does not always result in better accuracies due to overfitting. Similarly, too little of training data may result in underfitting. 
- Number of iterations also play apart in the accuracy of model.
